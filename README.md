# 🧬 SVM - Breast Cancer Classification

This project implements Support Vector Machines (SVM) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to classify tumors as **benign (0)** or **malignant (1)**.

## 📌 Objective
- Use both **Linear** and **RBF** kernels to train SVM models.
- Tune hyperparameters (`C`, `gamma`) using GridSearchCV.
- Visualize decision boundary using PCA-reduced 2D data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- PCA (for visualization)

## 📁 Files
- `SVM_Breast_Cancer.ipynb` — Google Colab notebook with complete code and comments.
- `breast-cancer.csv` — Dataset to upload manually in Colab.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repo or upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Run the cells one by one.
3. Upload `breast-cancer.csv` manually when prompted in Colab.
4. Tune and evaluate your model, and visualize decision boundaries.

## 📊 Output
- Classification report with precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- Decision boundary visualization using PCA
